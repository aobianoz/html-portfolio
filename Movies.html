<h1>The Best Movies or Shows of 2024-2025 According to Allin</h1>

<h2>My Top Ten Movies</h2>
<hr/>

<ol>
<li><h3>Devil May Cry Netflix Series</h3></li>
<p>Although it is not cannon to the origianal Devil May cry story this anime is a great adaptation to a iconic Capcom original character.</p>

<li><h3>Blue Eyed Samurai Netflix Series</h3></li>
<p>This is anime done right! Best feamale protagonist if ever seen in a anime series!!!</p>

<li><h3>Cyber Punk Netflix Series</h3></li>
<p>I wasn't big on the anime art style but the story was fantastic.  I was really disappointed with the end.</p>

<li><h3>Castle Vania Netflix Series</h3></li>
<p>Not sure what got me to watch this! Never the less I enjoyed it!</p>

<li><h3>Arcane Netflix Series</h3></li>
<p>The draw for this series is the art style.  The Icing in the cake is the story.  Warning!!! This story is very sad.</p>

<li><h3>Wanda Vision Disney Series</h3></li>
<p>If you are looking for a series where the plot and the climax builds slowly Wanda Vision is it.</p>

<li><h3>The Boys Amazon Prime </h3></li>
<p>Beware!  This is not for children!!!  Over the top action and gore!!!</p>

<li><h3>Reacher Amazon Prime</h3></li>
<p>Another show that I couldn't put my finger on why I was drawn to it!!!</p>

<li><h3>Dune Part 1 and 2</h3></li>
<p>Best movie I've seen about duty to family, betrayal, and prophecy!!!</p>

<li><h3>Rebel Moon Netflix Series</h3></li>
<p>I am a big fan of Zack Snyder and I think Rebel Moon, uniquely, poses a forward fision in cinema quality.</p>
